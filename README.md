# ProjectForMilitaria
Application that manages product data from external files XML, JSON (from ALLEGRO API). You can create your own, view, delete, edit. It is necessary to log in , to have access, to the rest . If a person registers and logs into the system as: emali/login: "admin@gmail.com" , he has access to everything. And if as another person then delete and edit only can be on their own created files. If you create files additionally to the Photos/Category list, then if you type in one field : "empty" and in the other some name, then only one record is created, or some Category, or photo. At startup, the application checks if there are any empty tables, if so, it loads the data from the FIles directory, which has 5 xml files and one file already downloaded from the Allegro API -> List of Orders. It also checks if there are any migrations, if so it automatically loads into the database. 
The first time you connect, you need to in appSetting.json -> set the database connection, then, run the program. It should create a new database by itself : ProjectMilitariaDb, create new tables, populate with data from files. If any problem then manually execute update-database command, or remove all migration : add-migration Init and then update-database. Tomorrow I will upload a more detailed description with pictures.
